# ABSTRACT

Although there is a requirement for English to Indian language translation, there are no proper and enough tools for the translators to use, because of the complexities involved in it. The research in developing Machine translation systems is going on but they are not yet to the stage of product or useful systems development. Major reason is the word level, phrase level and semantic level translation complexities involved because of the different cultures and use of the languages and non availability of good quality Translation Memories. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. This paper proposes integration of these two methods to get the respective advantages of both the systems providing better translation support systems for translators to work faster without compromising quality and help human translator to maintain proper writing styles intact.
